## Whats that?
`No memes?` is a simple Chrome Extension that redirects to a random shitpost/meme.

## How does that work?
`No memes?` is using `Meme API` which docs u can see [here](https://docs.jimijs.pl/memeapi/get-a-random-meme-api).

## What browser is it supporting?
For this time, only `Chrome` and `Chromium based` browsers  like `Opera`.

## How to install?
1. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
2. Toggle `Developer mode`
3. Click `Load unpacked extension`
4. Navigate to the extensionâ€™s folder and click OK
5. You can now delete the extension's folder, it should've been copied.

`This only works for chrome ^ More web browsers will be supported soon`
